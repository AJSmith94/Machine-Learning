# Machine-Learning
Machine learning project on detecting counterfeit banknotes.

In this project, we will discuss two machine learning techniques: random forests
and artificial neural networks and use them to perform classification tasks. The
project begins by examining decision trees, which form the basis of random
forests, and applying these to 2 datasets. We improve on the classifications
performed by decision trees by implementing a more sophisticated method on
one particular dataset: random forests. We then assess the efiectiveness of this
method. Finally, we discuss an alternative machine learning technique: artifcial
neural networks, and again assess how well this model performs a classification task.
Afterwards, we discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of
each method and discuss how a statistician may decide which machine learning
method to implement for a given classification problem on a dataset.
